This repository contains code and documentation that describes what I have learned from the Arduino starter kit.

## Project 2: Spaceship Interface

In this project, I learned the basics of controlling the pins on the Arduino board using the commands pinMode(), digitalRead(), and digitalWrite ().

The code is designed to flash between the two red LEDs controlled by pins 4 and 5 whenever the button is pressed. We detect the button being pressed by reading the state of pin 2.

Otherwise, the green LED is turned on, by writing a HIGH output to pin 3.
